# LanguageTranslationTransformer-LTT-
# ðŸ§  Custom Language Translation Transformer (Englishâ€“Telugu)

This project implements a Transformer-based model from scratch. It translates sentences from **English to Telugu**, demonstrating deep understanding of sequence-to-sequence learning, self-attention mechanisms, and positional encodings.
